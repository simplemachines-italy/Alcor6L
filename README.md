Alcor6L
=======

Alcor6L is a software system for natively programming
microcontrollers (interactively and incrementally) using
any of the following programming languages:

* Lua (using eLua)
* C (using PicoC)
* LISP (using PicoLisp and TinyScheme)
* BASIC (using MY-BASIC)

The Alcor6L system reads commands in any of the above
languages from the SD card or from the console (over UART,
USB or Telnet)

Alcor6L is a fork of the eLua project.

For now, Alcor6L runs on the following hardware:

* Mizar32 models A and B from simplemachines.it
* LM3S and STM32 ARM Cortex M3 boards
